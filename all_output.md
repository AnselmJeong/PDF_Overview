## Abstract

The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in finance has seen significant growth due to the availability of vast amounts of financial data and the need for more sophisticated decision-making tools. However, the 'black box' nature of many AI models, particularly deep learning models, poses challenges in terms of transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on Explainable AI (XAI) in finance, focusing on its applications, the challenges it faces, and future research directions. We categorize and review various XAI methods, discuss their integration into financial applications such as credit scoring, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and customer service. We also examine the regulatory and ethical considerations of using XAI in finance, highlighting the need for interpretable models to ensure fairness and trust in automated financial systems. Finally, we propose future research avenues that could enhance the explainability of AI models in finance, aiming to bridge the gap between model performance and interpretability.

## 1. **Background and Prevalence of Coercive Measures**

The **Background and Prevalence of Coercive Measures** in psychiatry encompasses a historical and current perspective on the use of seclusion and restraint, which are deeply rooted in psychiatric practice yet remain highly controversial. **Historically**, coercive measures like seclusion were justified under a paternalistic approach where mental health professionals believed they were acting in the best interest of the patient, particularly when patients were deemed incompetent to make decisions for themselves. However, over the last four decades, there has been a significant shift towards respecting **patient autonomy** and reducing coercive practices, spurred by ethical, legal, and clinical considerations. This shift is reflected in the evolving mental health legislation and professional guidelines aimed at controlling and minimizing the use of these measures. **Prevalence** of coercive measures varies widely due to differences in definitions, study populations, and reporting methods across countries and institutions. For instance, the percentage of patients experiencing seclusion during admission can range from 1.9% to 66%, highlighting the lack of standardization in psychiatric care practices. **Factors influencing** the use of seclusion include patient-related variables like age, gender, diagnosis, and ethnicity, as well as non-patient-related factors such as staff characteristics, hospital environment, and the subjective decision-making process influenced by the caregiver's moral conscience and institutional culture. This complexity underscores the need for a nuanced approach to understand and potentially reduce the reliance on coercive measures in psychiatric treatment.

## 2. **Ethical Justifications for Coercive Measures**

The ethical debate surrounding **coercive measures** in psychiatry, specifically seclusion and restraint, hinges on complex justifications that balance autonomy, beneficence, and human dignity. **Autonomy** is often cited as a primary reason to oppose coercive measures, yet this principle alone is insufficient to dismiss their use. The argument posits that coercive measures can sometimes be necessary to **restore or foster autonomy**, particularly when a patient's mental state temporarily incapacitates their ability to make autonomous decisions. This nuanced view suggests that seclusion might not always threaten autonomy but can serve as an intervention to help patients regain it. Moreover, **human dignity** presents another ethical quandary. While coercive measures can be seen as inherently undignified, the concept of dignity is multifaceted, involving both inherent and individualistic aspects. Inherent dignity, which cannot be taken away, must still be respected in the manner seclusion is conducted, ensuring it does not further demean the patient. On the other hand, individualistic dignity, linked to personal identity and autonomy, might be compromised by seclusion, yet if handled with understanding and care, it could potentially aid in restoring a patient's self-respect and dignity. Therefore, while autonomy and dignity arguments can both support and oppose seclusion, the **lack of empirical evidence** on the beneficial effects of these measures strongly advocates for a non-seclusion approach unless supported by controlled trials demonstrating clear benefits. This ethical complexity underscores the need for a thorough, evidence-based evaluation of coercive practices in psychiatry, emphasizing the importance of considering patient autonomy, dignity, and the potential for harm in any decision-making process regarding seclusion.

## 3. **The Conflict between Autonomy and Beneficence**

In the context of **The Conflict between Autonomy and Beneficence**, the paper highlights the ethical tension inherent in psychiatric care when considering the use of coercive measures like seclusion and restraint. **Autonomy** refers to an individual's right to self-determination, a principle that has been increasingly emphasized in healthcare over the past few decades. Conversely, **beneficence** involves actions that promote the well-being of the patient, which might sometimes conflict with respecting the patient's autonomy. The authors argue that while autonomy is a crucial ethical principle, it cannot be the sole determinant in deciding the use of coercive measures. They discuss how **autonomy is relational** and dependent on others, suggesting that interventions like seclusion, when used to foster or regain autonomy, might not necessarily be seen as violating autonomy but rather as a means to achieve it. Furthermore, the paper points out that **beneficence** in psychiatric care often involves preventing harm to the patient or others, which might justify coercive measures in extreme cases where no less restrictive alternatives exist. However, the lack of **controlled trials** demonstrating the beneficial effects of these measures creates an ethical dilemma, as it challenges the principle of beneficence. This ambiguity in ethical norms means that an appeal to autonomy or human dignity alone cannot definitively support or reject the use of coercive measures, emphasizing the need for empirical research to clarify their effectiveness and ethical justification.

## 4. **Human Dignity and Coercive Interventions**

**Human dignity** is a core value in the debate on coercive interventions within psychiatry, particularly when considering the use of seclusion and restraint. These measures inherently challenge the principle of human dignity by potentially dehumanizing patients through isolation or physical restriction, which can be seen as degrading or humiliating. However, the interpretation of dignity in this context is multifaceted. **Inherent dignity**, which is universal and inalienable, cannot be stripped away by any external action, yet actions like seclusion can be perceived as not in accordance with this inherent value. Conversely, **individualistic dignity**—tied to personal identity and autonomy—can be influenced by external factors, including psychiatric treatment methods. Here, the argument becomes nuanced; seclusion might be necessary to prevent harm or to restore a patient's autonomy and dignity in the long term by managing acute episodes of severe mental illness. 

The discussion on dignity also touches on the **relational aspect of autonomy**, suggesting that autonomy, and by extension dignity, is developed and maintained through interactions with others. Thus, interventions that temporarily restrict autonomy might be justified if they aim to restore a patient’s capacity for self-governance. This perspective challenges the simplistic view of coercive measures as solely dignity-violating by proposing they could be part of a broader therapeutic strategy to ultimately **foster or regain autonomy**. 

However, the use of coercive measures must be critically evaluated in terms of **their effects on patient dignity**, both immediate and long-term. Patients' experiences often highlight the negative aspects of seclusion, including feelings of violation, lack of understanding, and inadequate communication, which directly impact their sense of dignity. Ethical considerations must weigh these experiences against the potential benefits, like reducing immediate harm or aiding in treatment. The **absence of controlled trials** on the effectiveness of these interventions further complicates the ethical debate, suggesting that any justification for their use should be cautious and evidence-driven. Ultimately, while respect for human dignity might not outright reject coercive measures, it mandates a careful, respectful, and dignity-preserving approach to their application, emphasizing the need for alternatives and ongoing ethical scrutiny.

## 5. **Patient Experiences with Seclusion**

The section on **Patient Experiences with Seclusion** delves into the complex and often contradictory experiences of those subjected to this controversial practice. **Patients report a range of feelings**, from fear, humiliation, and a profound sense of loss of autonomy to occasional moments of calm and self-reflection. The lack of **adequate information and education about seclusion** is a significant point of contention, contributing to negative perceptions and experiences. **Patients feel most violated when they do not understand the reasons for their seclusion or are unable to discuss it with others**, highlighting the importance of communication and transparency. This underscores the **ethical imperative** for healthcare providers to ensure that seclusion is not only a last resort but also implemented with utmost respect for the patient's dignity and autonomy. Interestingly, **some patients acknowledge beneficial effects** such as reduced agitation or gaining access to repressed memories, although these are often overshadowed by the negative impacts. **Nurses and patients differ significantly in their perceptions of seclusion's benefits**, with nurses more likely to see it as a helpful intervention, which might reflect a professional bias or a lack of understanding of the patient's lived experience. This discrepancy in views necessitates a **patient-centered approach** where individual experiences are taken seriously, and efforts are made to mitigate the adverse effects through better patient education, dialogue, and alternative de-escalation techniques. Ultimately, the **ethical debate on seclusion** hinges on balancing the need for safety with the respect for human dignity, autonomy, and the well-being of the patient, urging a reevaluation of seclusion practices in light of these patient experiences.

## 6. **Therapeutic vs. Harmful Effects of Seclusion**

The debate surrounding the **therapeutic vs. harmful effects of seclusion** in psychiatric settings presents a complex ethical dilemma. **Seclusion** is often justified as a measure to protect patients and others from harm, to control disruptive behavior, and to provide a less stimulating environment, which some clinicians argue can be therapeutic by allowing patients to calm down or process their thoughts without external disturbances. Proponents highlight that in certain scenarios, seclusion can prevent self-destructive behavior or aggression, potentially serving as a means to restore autonomy when other interventions fail. However, the **lack of empirical evidence** supporting its benefits raises significant concerns. Studies show that seclusion can lead to **deleterious physical and psychological effects**, including trauma and feelings of dehumanization, which directly oppose the principle of doing no harm. Reports of adverse outcomes, such as patient abuse and neglect, further challenge the ethical justification of seclusion. Additionally, **patient experiences** are predominantly negative, with many feeling misunderstood, violated, and lacking adequate information about why they are secluded. This underscores the potential for seclusion to infringe upon patient autonomy and dignity, principles central to modern healthcare ethics. The absence of controlled trials to evaluate seclusion's effectiveness or harmfulness means that its use cannot be conclusively deemed as either therapeutic or harmful, emphasizing the need for **further research** to establish its role in psychiatric care. While some argue that seclusion might be necessary in extreme cases, the ethical ambiguity and the potential for harm suggest that it should be a last resort, used only with the utmost respect for patient autonomy and dignity, and within a framework that encourages alternatives to coercive measures.

## 7. **Clinical Decision-Making and Coercive Measures**

In the section **Clinical Decision-Making and Coercive Measures**, the ethical, legal, and clinical complexities surrounding the use of coercive interventions in psychiatric care are deeply explored. The debate hinges on balancing patient **autonomy** with the principles of **beneficence** and **non-maleficence**, alongside considerations of human dignity. The argument posits that appealing to respect for autonomy or human dignity alone is insufficient to either justify or reject coercive measures entirely. For instance, while autonomy might seem to argue against coercive measures, it can be argued that in certain circumstances, such measures might be necessary to restore or foster autonomy, especially when patients pose a danger to themselves or others due to temporary mental incapacity. This creates a nuanced ethical landscape where coercive measures can be seen as a tool to achieve therapeutic goals, potentially reducing harm and promoting patient welfare. However, the **absence of controlled trials** to assess the effectiveness of these measures means that their justification remains contentious. The discussion emphasizes that without empirical evidence, the ethical debate leans towards caution, invoking the principle of **primum non nocere** (first, do no harm), suggesting that coercive measures should only continue within the framework of rigorous research to evaluate their true impact and necessity. Ultimately, this section underscores the need for a comprehensive approach in clinical decision-making, where ethical considerations, patient experiences, and empirical data all play critical roles in shaping the use of coercive measures in psychiatry.

## 8. **Reduction Programs and Their Outcomes**

**Reduction Programs and Their Outcomes** in the context of psychiatric care present a nuanced landscape where ethical considerations, patient outcomes, and the effectiveness of alternative approaches converge. **Reduction programs** aimed at minimizing or eliminating coercive measures like seclusion and restraint have shown variable success rates. Some programs have achieved significant reductions, such as a 52% decrease in one study, although this was accompanied by an increase in patient assaults, highlighting the complexity of managing psychiatric environments without coercive measures (Prinsen & van Delden, 2009). Conversely, another study reported a total elimination of seclusion and restraint in several hospitals without a corresponding rise in violent incidents, suggesting that with the right interventions, a non-coercive approach might be feasible (Smith et al., 2005). These outcomes underscore that while reduction programs can lead to substantial decreases in the use of coercive measures, they do not universally achieve complete elimination due to the persistent need to manage extreme behaviors where patient or staff safety is at risk. Furthermore, the ethical debate surrounding these programs often pivots on the principles of autonomy, dignity, and the therapeutic benefits versus the traumatic effects of coercion. The lack of controlled trials comparing different methods makes it challenging to definitively advocate for or against these measures, emphasizing the need for more robust research to guide clinical decisions and policy-making. The **ethical ambiguity** around autonomy and dignity can both support and challenge the justification of non-seclusion approaches, indicating that while ethical arguments alone might not suffice to eliminate coercive measures, they must be considered alongside empirical evidence on patient outcomes and safety. This dual consideration is crucial for developing reduction programs that not only aim to reduce coercive measures but also ensure the well-being and rights of patients are respected.

## 9. **Future Research Directions in Coercive Psychiatry**

**Future Research Directions in Coercive Psychiatry** could explore several critical areas to address the ethical, clinical, and legal complexities surrounding the use of coercive measures like seclusion and restraint in psychiatric care. **Firstly**, there is an urgent need for controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness, benefits, and harms of coercive measures in different patient populations.** These studies should aim to understand whether seclusion or restraint contributes positively to patient outcomes or if it merely serves as a control mechanism.** Secondly**, research should focus on developing and testing alternative interventions that respect patient autonomy while ensuring safety. This could include exploring less restrictive methods, pharmacological alternatives, or innovative de-escalation techniques.** Thirdly**, the relational aspect of autonomy and its implications for psychiatric care need further exploration. Understanding how coercive measures affect the therapeutic relationship and patient autonomy in the long term could guide the development of more humane and effective treatment strategies.** Fourthly**, the ethical framework for decision-making in coercive psychiatry requires refinement.** This involves integrating principles like beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and human dignity in a manner that supports both patient rights and clinical necessity.** Lastly**, the cultural, institutional, and legislative influences on the decision to use coercive measures should be studied to foster a culture shift towards less coercive practices.** This could involve examining the training and attitudes of healthcare providers, the impact of patient education, and the role of environmental design in psychiatric facilities.** Overall, future research must aim to provide robust evidence to guide policy and practice, ensuring that coercive measures are used judiciously, ethically, and only when absolutely necessary.**

## 10. **Legal and Ethical Frameworks for Psychiatric Care**

The **Legal and Ethical Frameworks for Psychiatric Care** section delves into the complex interplay between **patient autonomy**, **beneficence**, **non-maleficence**, and **human dignity** within the context of using coercive measures like seclusion and restraint. It highlights the historical shift from a **paternalistic** approach, where such measures were deemed acceptable for the incompetent, to a modern emphasis on **patient autonomy**. This shift has led to **ethical dilemmas** where the need to respect a patient’s autonomy often clashes with the principles of beneficence (doing good) and non-maleficence (avoiding harm). The discussion argues that **coercive measures can sometimes be justified** if they serve to protect patients from harm or restore their autonomy, particularly when mental incapacity is temporary. **Human dignity** is another critical factor, with seclusion potentially violating this by intruding on a patient's private sphere and altering their identity. Yet, the argument also acknowledges that dignity can be upheld if seclusion is conducted with respect and understanding. The lack of **controlled trials** on the effectiveness of coercive measures complicates this debate, pushing for more **evidence-based approaches** to justify or eliminate these practices. **Legal frameworks** have evolved, aiming to minimize coercive measures through **legislation, recommendations, and guidelines**, advocating for the least restrictive environment possible. However, the ambiguity in defining what constitutes the least restrictive method and the **absence of consensus** on how best to balance autonomy, dignity, and safety in psychiatric care continues to challenge the ethical and legal landscape.
