### TL;DR

The use of coercive measures in psychiatry, like seclusion, has been controversial. Despite some advocating for their elimination, ethical considerations are complex, balancing patient autonomy with safety concerns. **The paper examines whether these measures can be justified, focusing on ethical principles, patient experiences, and the lack of empirical evidence**. It argues that while autonomy and human dignity are crucial, they alone cannot justify eliminating coercive measures. The key is the absence of controlled trials showing their effectiveness or harmfulness, suggesting that their use should be reconsidered in the context of evidence-based practices.

### Key Takeaways

['Autonomy and dignity alone are not sufficient reasons to eliminate coercive measures in psychiatry.', "Lack of controlled trials on the effects of seclusion means there's no evidence to support or refute its use effectively.", 'Reduction programs show that in extreme circumstances, coercive measures might still be necessary.']

### Importance to Researchers

This paper is vital for researchers in **psychiatry, ethics, and evidence-based medicine**. It highlights the need for empirical research to guide the use of coercive measures, opens avenues for exploring alternative interventions, and questions current practices in mental health care.

>The practice of coercive measures in psychiatry is controversial. Although some have suggested that it may be acceptable if patients are a danger to others or themselves, others committed themselves to eliminate it. Ethical, legal and clinical considerations become more complex when the mental incapacity is temporary and when the coercive measures serve to restore autonomy. We discuss these issues, addressing the conflict between autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence, human dignity, the experiences of patients and the effects of coercive measures. We argue that an appeal to respect autonomy and/or human dignity cannot be a sufficient reason to reject coercive measures. All together, these ethical aspects can both support and reject a non-seclusion approach.

### 1. Background
The **Background** section of the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the practice of seclusion in psychiatry, emphasizing its definition, prevalence, and associated factors. Seclusion is defined as locking a patient alone in a room to protect both the patient and their environment, control problem behavior, and enable nursing and treatment. While some see seclusion as a treatment failure, others report therapeutic effects like calming patients and allowing access to repressed memories. However, the frequency of seclusion remains unclear due to varying definitions, study populations, and endpoints, with reported involvement percentages ranging from 1.9% to 66%. The decision to use seclusion is influenced by both patient-related factors (age, gender, diagnosis, ethnicity) and non-patient-related factors (staff characteristics, hospital environment). The section concludes by questioning whether a complete non-seclusion approach can be justified, given the complexity of factors influencing its use.

### 2. Ethical Issues
#### 2.1. Autonomy
The **Autonomy** subsection discusses the ethical principle of autonomy in the context of psychiatric care. The shift towards more patient autonomy over the last 40 years has led to debates about paternalistic practices like seclusion. The authors argue that while autonomy is crucial, it is not the sole ethical principle to consider; other principles like beneficence also play a significant role. They cite Beauchamp & Childress, who argue that autonomy should not override all other moral considerations, emphasizing a relational view of autonomy that acknowledges the impact of social interactions and relationships on individual autonomy. The argument posits that coercive measures like seclusion might sometimes be necessary to foster or regain autonomy, challenging the view that seclusion inherently threatens autonomy.

#### 2.2. Human Dignity
In the **Human Dignity** subsection, the authors explore how seclusion might violate human dignity. They discuss two forms of dignity: inherent, which cannot be taken away, and individualistic, which can be affected by external circumstances. Seclusion could be seen as violating inherent dignity by not treating patients in accordance with their inherent worth, while its impact on individualistic dignity is less clear. The authors note that while seclusion might intrude on a patient's private sphere and identity, if executed with respect, understanding, and by competent staff, it might not necessarily violate dignity. They argue that the disease itself might already rob patients of their dignity, and seclusion could be a means to help regain it, suggesting that dignity concerns do not outright block the use of seclusion but influence how it should be conducted.

#### 2.3. Experiences of Patients
The **Experiences of Patients** subsection examines patient experiences with seclusion, highlighting both negative and positive aspects. While many patients report negative experiences, particularly when not informed or unable to discuss the reasons for seclusion, some also acknowledge benefits, particularly over time. Studies show a discrepancy between nurses and patients regarding the perceived benefits of seclusion, with patients generally less convinced of its benefits. This suggests that while seclusion might not be favored for complete elimination by all patients, the manner and frequency of its use need careful consideration and communication to mitigate negative experiences.

### 3. Discussion
The **Discussion** section revisits the ethical arguments around seclusion, concluding that neither autonomy nor human dignity alone can definitively support or reject a non-seclusion approach. The ambiguity in these concepts allows for interpretations that can both justify and criticize seclusion. The authors point out the lack of controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of seclusion, highlighting the need for evidence-based practice. They suggest that until such evidence is available, the principle of "primum non nocere" (first, do no harm) should guide clinical decisions, advocating for the exploration of alternatives to seclusion.

### 4. Conclusion
In the **Conclusion**, the authors argue that despite ethical considerations like autonomy and dignity not being sufficient to eliminate seclusion, the lack of empirical evidence supporting its benefits calls for caution. They propose that seclusion should only be continued within the context of randomized trials to assess its effects in extreme circumstances and compare it with alternatives like forced medication. They stress the necessity of research to understand the beneficial effects of seclusion, emphasizing that current ethical arguments alone cannot resolve the debate on its use without empirical backing.
