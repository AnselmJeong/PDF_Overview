ABSTRACT
The practice of coercive measures in psychiatry is
controversial. Although some have suggested that it may
be acceptable if patients are a danger to others or to
themselves, others committed themselves to eliminate it.
Ethical, legal and clinical considerations become more
complex when the mental incapacity is temporary and
when the coercive measures serve to restore autonomy.
We discuss these issues, addressing the conflict between
autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence, human dignity, the experiences of patients and the effects of
coercive measures. We argue that an appeal to respect
autonomy and/or human dignity cannot be a sufficient
reason to reject coercive measures. All together, these
ethical aspects can be used both to support and to reject
a non-seclusion approach.
The total lack of controlled trials about the beneficial
effects of coercive measures in different populations
however, argues against the use of coercive measures.

Ethical concerns about methods in psychiatry have
been discussed for at least three centuries.[1]

Methods used for controlling behaviour, such as
seclusion and restraint, have been particularly
questioned.[2 3] A consensus, concerning an optimal
theoretical framework for ethical decision-making,
has not yet been reached.[4] Until the 1960s mental
health legislation reflected a paternalistic approach
towards involuntary psychiatric treatment, including seclusion, and this was considered to be
acceptable in the case of patients who were
incompetent to decide.[5] In the last 40 years we
have witnessed a development towards more
patient autonomy in healthcare.[6] This has resulted
in renewed discussions about the use of seclusion
and restraint in psychiatry.[7] New legislation,
recommendations and professional guidelines to
control the use of coercive measures in psychiatry
have since then emerged.[8] In recent literature many
institutions, associations and hospitals have come
up with programmes to reduce seclusion and
restraint.[5 9–13] The reasons named to substantiate
the need for reduction of seclusion and restraint
are: respect for autonomy, human dignity and the
net negative consequences in the sense of traumatic and harmful experiences during seclusion
and restraint. At the same time coercion remained
justified in certain circumstances in which patients
are a danger to others or to themselves.[9 14–17] Some
go further and committed themselves to eliminating the use of seclusion and restraint completely.[12 18] The contribution this paper wants to
make is to discuss whether we can justify not using


BACKGROUND
Definition and prevalence
There are a number of definitions for seclusion in
the international literature. Lendemeijer has formulated the following definition after reviewing
the literature on seclusion in psychiatry: ‘‘Locking
a patient alone in a room for protection of the
patient and his environment and in order to
control problem behaviour and to enable nursing
and treatment’’.[7] Patients can voluntarily choose to
be secluded, however this paper will address
involuntarily use of seclusion. The definition above
implies that seclusion itself is not a form of
treatment but an intervention to make treatment
possible. Some people even see the use of seclusion
and restraint as treatment failure.[11 12] Some articles
do, however, describe therapeutic effects of seclusion; patients become calm and gain access to
repressed memories during seclusion due to
decreased stimulation from sensory overload. Also
it has been described that seclusion provides
effective means for preventing injury and reducing
agitation.[19 20] The question remains whether effects
should be attributed to the seclusion room itself, to
the placement of a patient in a seclusion room, or
to all activities around the secluded patient.
Seclusion is still commonly used in psychiatry,
however the frequency of use is unclear. There is
great variation in the type and frequency of using
coercive measures between countries. Published
research studies mostly report data from one
hospital, which may not be representative of
practice in the country of origin.[21] Furthermore,
studies published use different definitions of
seclusion, study different populations and use
different endpoints to express the frequency,
which makes comparison difficult. Percentages of
patients who are involved with seclusion during an
admission vary from 1.9–66%, and the average
duration also varies greatly between countries and
hospitals and study populations.[7 20]

Patient-related and non-patient-related influences
The associations between seclusion and patientrelated factors of age, gender, diagnosis and
ethnicity are also unclear; seclusion seems to be
associated with younger patients and a diagnosis of
schizophrenia, manic-states or personality disorders.[5 7 8 12 19 22–24]

Characteristics of the staff, such as their educational level, clinical experience and gender also
seem to be factors associated with seclusion.[7 9 20] In
addition hospital characteristics seem to play a
role, for example, architectural aspects and the
patient-to-staff ratio For instance the frequency of


-----

rooms decreases.[25] Taxis concludes in his article that staff
education, patient education, environmental alterations, good
communication and administrative and programmatic changes
are factors that have contributed to the reduction of seclusion
and restraint.[9]

Another important factor in the decision to seclude is the
person who makes that decision. Any given situation of
deciding on seclusion will be based on the history of the
subjective self of the decision-maker.[26] This means that the
moral conscience of the caregiver, the culture of the institution
in which he works, the legislation, former decisions and the
ideas of colleagues, relatives and superiors play a key role in the
decision to seclude or not. In order to reduce the use of seclusion
and restraint a change of culture is the key.[11]

We can conclude that the decision to use seclusion not only
depends on the behaviour of the patient but also on many
complex factors associated with the caregiver and the institution. This causes discussion about the use of seclusion as such.
Therefore it is time to discuss the question whether a complete
non-seclusion approach can be justified.

ETHICAL ISSUES
At first glance respect for autonomy and the violation of human
dignity would seem to support a non-seclusion approach.
Likewise, the effects of seclusion—protection from harm and
creating a therapeutic climate—would seem to support the use
of seclusion.

Autonomy
As mentioned already, the development towards more patient
autonomy in healthcare is a trend of the last 40 years. A
presumption in favour of individual self-determination has
developed, and critique on a paternalistic approach to the
healthcare relationship.[27] The consequences of this for psychiatry are expressed by P Soloff: ‘‘As attitudes toward ‘madness’
become more enlightened, social pressure toward greater freedom and less restrictive care push the psychiatrist to the limits
of safety in managing the truly disturbed patient’’.[28]

There have been three kinds of attacks against a central role
for autonomy in medical ethics.
Firstly, autonomy is just one of the prima facie principles to
take account of; there is no reason why autonomy should have
priority over all other moral considerations as, for instance,
beneficence. Beauchamp & Childress,[29] in their influential book
about biomedical ethics, firmly deny that respect for autonomy
overrides all other moral considerations. They construct a
conception of autonomy that is not excessively individualistic
(ie, not neglecting the social nature of individuals and the
impact of individual choices and actions on others), and not
unduly legalistic (ie, not highlighting legal rights and downplaying social practices).[29]

Secondly, the concept of autonomy itself is broader; the ideal
of autonomy in terms of complete self-sufficiency and
independency, free from controlling factors does not exist. It
has been argued that autonomy cannot be seen in isolation from
other persons and relationships. Instead, it has been stressed
that autonomy as a moral capacity can only be developed in
relation to others; in other words, autonomy is relational
autonomy.[30]

Thirdly, there are moral values which are more fundamental
than autonomy. Campbell,[27] following Pellegrino, argues that
dependency is a moral principle and that it is more funda

individual could be lacking in autonomy, in the sense that he
cannot consistently exercise any degree of self-direction and
cannot function as a member of society. Conversely a
dependent individual (eg, a partner in a marriage) can still
exercise autonomy. Campbell claims that dependency and
autonomy are not polar opposites.[27]

The consequence of these attacks is that we cannot dismiss
seclusion by invoking autonomy only, without paying attention
to other moral principles and without paying attention to the
relational context of autonomy.
Verkerk agrees with this concept of autonomy and dependency in which the relational context plays an important role
and pleas for the possibility of ‘‘compassionate interference’’ in
healthcare. ‘‘Interventions in care can be shown to be in the
interest of patients, that is they can be seen as interventions for
attaining autonomy instead of threatening autonomy’’.[30] So it
can be argued that to avoid self-destructive behaviour sometimes coercive measures can be necessary to foster or to regain
autonomy. When we see seclusion as an intervention for
attaining autonomy instead of threatening autonomy we have
lost one reason for eliminating seclusion completely. Obviously,
this does not mean that seclusion does not raise many issues
related to autonomy.
It seems the natural thing to consider paternalism here as
well. Paternalism has been described as a conflict between
beneficence and autonomy.[29] However, since we will show that
there are no scientific grounds for the beneficial effect of
seclusion or restraint for the psychiatric patient, there can not
be a conflict between violating autonomy and beneficence. Even
if we would assume (in the absence of supporting data), that
seclusion itself is beneficent using it would amount to a form of
weak paternalism because a person’s competency will be
compromised in some way by its psychiatric disorder.

Human dignity
Violation of human dignity is often used as an argument against
seclusion.[18 31 32] With regard to the application of biology and
medicine the dignity and identity of all human beings must be
protected and respect for their integrity, without discrimination, and other rights and fundamental freedoms must be
guaranteed.[33]

Human dignity is often used as a central concept in our
contemporary moral vocabulary, but both the content of the
notion and its basis as a moral category are often left
unspecified; there is not enough clarity about the meaning of
human dignity.[34] There are at least two conceptions of dignity:
(1) ‘‘inherent dignity’’ of every human person as a universal and
inalienable moral quality which can not be earned and can not
be taken away; and (2) ‘‘individualistic dignity’’ that is tied to
personal goals and social circumstances, which can be either
enhanced or diminished depending upon a variety of circumstances. Dignity, in this sense, can be affected by events outside
the control of the persons involved, a debilitating disease, for
example, might rob one of one’s dignity.[35]

In the context of seclusion a violation of inherent dignity will
mostly be the case. Although this characteristic of humans
cannot be taken away from the patient, we can act in a way
that is not in accordance with it and as such violate it. In case of
‘‘individualistic dignity’’, however, things are less clear.
Nordenfelt describes ‘‘the dignity of identity’’ as ‘‘the dignity
that we attach to ourselves as integrated and autonomous
persons, persons with a history and persons with a future with
all out relationships to other human beings’’ [36] This dignity is


-----

Nordenfelt argues that other persons can humiliate us and can
restrict our autonomy in many ways; this however does not just
entail feelings of worthlessness or of humiliation. Intrusion in
the private sphere is a violation of a person’s integrity but it also
entails a change in the person’s identity and thereby his dignity.
In this sense it can be argued that seclusion does intrude in
the private sphere of the patient and entails a change in the
patient’s identity and thereby violates the patient dignity. In
this way it can be argued that we ought not to use seclusion.
On the other hand a study about patients’ perceptions of the
concept of dignity in a psychiatric setting showed that
‘‘encountering competent and committed staff’’, ‘‘being confirmed’’, ‘‘being looked upon as like anyone else’’, ‘‘being helped to
reduce the shame’’ and ‘‘being understood’’ are conditions
associated with respect for dignity.[37] It is unclear if seclusion
violates human dignity in this sense, when it is done by
competent staff, with confirmation and understanding of the
patient and in a way that reduces the shame. It seems that respect
for human dignity in this view says nothing about whether we
should use seclusion or not but about the way we use it.
Furthermore, it can be argued that patients have already been
robbed of their dignity by their disease and the situation that
leads to seclusion. Both Pullman and Nordenfelt argue that a
disabling disease can rob one of one’s dignity. Seclusion might
be necessary to reach a breakthrough in the situation and to
regain one’s dignity by regaining self-respect. When we argue in
this way, it follows that seclusion remains a problem in one
understanding of dignity, but does not necessarily block the use
of seclusion in another. That view leads to the conclusion that
seclusion must be done with respect for human dignity in a way
that is least violating.

Experiences of patients
Another important issue in the moral debate on seclusion are
the experiences of patients; do they feel non-autonomous and
violated in their dignity? Literature predominantly reports
negative seclusion room experiences, but positive experiences
have also been reported, especially a considerable time after
seclusion.[38] Important factors mentioned by patients are the
lack of adequate information and education about seclusion.[39]

Patients report most negative experiences when they do not
understand the reason for seclusion and when they do not have
the possibilities to discuss it with others.[38] Treatment must be
individualised treatment which means that it must be discussed
with the patient, it must be reviewed and revised regularly, and it
must be provided by adequately qualified staff.[40]

Patients do see beneficial effects of seclusion to themselves. In
one study both nursing staff and patients generally believed
seclusion to be beneficial to the patient some of the time.
However, significant differences were found between nurses’
and patients’ perceptions of the extent of benefit, with only 4%
of patients and 60% of nurses believing the procedure to be
often beneficial to the secluded patient.[41]

These studies seem to say something about the way we use
seclusion and about the reasons and frequency of seclusion, not
about whether we should use it or not (as has been argued for
the violation of dignity). In Meehan’s study only 22% of the
patients and 2% of the staff were in favour of eliminating
seclusion completely.[41]

Effects of seclusion; promoting wellbeing
The definition of seclusion (locking a patient alone in a room for


control problem behaviour, and to enable nursing and treatment) implies that it is used with good intentions, namely to
protect the patient and his environment and to create a
therapeutic situation. This is a view of seclusion based on
doing good and avoiding (further) harm. Indications for
seclusion (and restraint) are: (1) to prevent imminent harm to
the patient or other persons; (2) to prevent serious disruption of
the treatment programme or significant damage to the physical
environment (to the patient or to the group); (3) to assist in
treatment as part of ongoing behaviour therapy; and (4) to
decrease the stimulation a patient receives.[42] Whether seclusion
helps to reach these goals is completely unclear as there is no
evidence for its effects. The conclusion of a review by the
Cochrane library in the year 2000 is that there are no controlled
studies that evaluate the value of seclusion or restraint in those
patients with serious mental illness.[43] Since then, as far we
know, no controlled trials have been published. In the absence
of controlled trials, the observations by clinicians remain and
they sometimes report positive effects, as mentioned before.[41]

These observations may be correct in the reported cases but the
question remains whether they would be the same in other
cases, whether these effects can be attributed to seclusion itself
and whether seclusion is the appropriate measure. There is no
evidence that seclusion is better than alternatives, such as forced
drug treatment in preventing harm and disruption, in assisting
in treatment and decreasing overstimulation.
Furthermore negative effects have been published. Fisher
concludes in his review that the use of seclusion and restraint
can have substantial deleterious physical and psychological
effects on both patient and staff.[19] The Citizens Commission on
Human Rights published Deadly restraints, psychiatry’s ‘‘therapeutic’’ assault, a report that summarised reports of deaths,
patient abuse and neglect as a result of seclusion and restraint.[44]

These reports, however, do not describe controlled trials about
the negative effects.
In the absence of any controlled trials in patients with serious
mental illness, no recommendation can be made about the
effectiveness, benefit or harmfulness of seclusion or restraint.
This lack of evidence and reports of serious adverse effects do
not mean that seclusion cannot be practical and safe. But when
we want to practice evidenced based medicine it is arguable that
the use of seclusion should only be continued in the context of
randomised trials.[43] The design of such a study will not be
without problems, but we submit that a study using a cluster
randomised design would be feasible and ethically defensible.
The lack of evidence of positive effects of seclusion supports a
non-seclusion approach. It should stimulate us to find
alternative methods of dealing with extreme circumstances of
aggressive behaviour in which the safety of the patient or others
is threatened.

DISCUSSION
At first we assumed that respect for autonomy and the violation
of human dignity would support a complete non-seclusion
approach. On basis of the explanation just given we can contest
this assumption. Both autonomy and dignity can be used to
support seclusion and to reject a non-seclusion approach. In a
certain way coercion voids an act of autonomy, on the other
hand it can be argued that seclusion in healthcare is sometimes
necessary for attaining autonomy, instead of always threatening autonomy.[29 30] To a certain extent the same goes for
(individualistic) dignity. The ambiguity in these ethical concepts makes clear that an appeal to respect for autonomy and/or


-----

But neither is this ambiguity sufficient reason to close all
criticism, and to continue using seclusion.
Because of the deleterious physical and psychological effects
described that seclusion can have on both patients and staff,
reduction of coercive measurement must be encouraged.[19] It is
remarkable however, that only 22% of patients who have been
secluded support a total elimination of seclusion.[41]

The assessment of the effectiveness of programmes to prevent
seclusion and restraint is hampered by the lack of parallel
control groups.[8] Variable results have been reported. One study
reports a 52% reduction of seclusion, this unfortunately was
accompanied by a significant increase of assault on patients.[10]

Another study, which used data of nine hospitals, reports a total
elimination of seclusion and restraint in five of the nine
hospitals, without an increase of patient assault.[12] Most
reduction programmes, however, do not reach a 100% reduction. It seems that there remain circumstances of extreme
problem behaviour with danger to the patient or others, which
need to be controlled by coercive measures such as seclusion,
restraint or forced medication. There is no data to guide clinical
decisions as to which combination of seclusion, restraint and/or
forced medication would be better in specific patient populations.[20] It can be argued, however, that forced drug treatment
might even be more harmful than seclusion. Part of this
argument is that the medication is given as an intramuscular
injection and thus violates the borders of the human body. Also
most medication causes a lowering of consciousness which can
be seen as violating autonomy. And when the patient is
admitted for the first time and has no known diagnosis, the
observation of a secluded patient can give the psychiatrist more
(diagnostic) information than observing a tranquilised patient.
On the other hand one could argue that there is a more direct
relation between some states of illness and giving specific
medication, for example, in cases of psychosis and anti
psychotic drugs. Obviously, this would not be the case when
tranquillisers are used as these drugs can be seen as a form of
chemical restraint.
An obvious hiatus in the total discussion about coercive
measures is the lack of clear definitions and data of its use, and
the total lack of trials in which different measures are compared
and effects are investigated.
The council of Europe, contrary to the earlier recommendations, states that the use of mechanical restraint is not
prohibited: ‘‘isolation and mechanical or other means of
restraint for prolonged periods should be resorted to only in
exceptional cases where there is no other means of remedying
the situation’’. Furthermore, patients have the right to receive
treatment in the least restrictive environment and using the
least restrictive means appropriate to the patient’s health and
the need to protect the safety of others.[40] There is, however, a
lack of consensus regarding which method is the least
restrictive.[20] This absence of data should guide future efficacy
and effectiveness studies.

CONCLUSION
In contrast to many reports, we have argued that reasons such
as respect for autonomy and the violation of human dignity are
not sufficient reasons to eliminate seclusion. Altogether, at least
in some interpretations, these norms can be used both to
support and to reject a non-seclusion approach.
Reduction programmes do not reach a 100% reduction of
coercive measures in psychiatry; there remain circumstances
wherein coercive measures seems to be the only option to


The total lack of controlled trials about the effects of
seclusion in different populations, however, argues against the
use of seclusion even in these extreme circumstances in which
the safety of the patient or others is threatened. It is very hard
to argue that seclusion is the appropriate measure to control
these circumstances when there are no data to support this. The
use of seclusion should therefore only be continued in the
context of randomised trials, in which the effects of seclusion in
extreme circumstance most be explored and in which this must
be compared with other measures such as forced drug
treatment. Designing a controlled trial in which individuals
are randomised to intervention may be difficult, but a cluster
randomised trial must be possible. We have argued that we can
neither rule out nor accept coercive measures relying on
autonomy or dignitarian grounds alone. We do need to know
whether coercive measures are beneficent to complete the
argument, and therefore research is necessary. For as long there
is no evidence for positive effects of seclusion the precaution
principle of ‘‘primum non nocere’’ should guide our actions.
