Although some have suggested that it may\\nbe acceptable if patients are a danger to others or to\\nthemselves, others committed themselves to eliminate it.\\nEthical, legal and clinical considerations become more\\ncomplex when the mental incapacity is temporary and\\nwhen the coercive measures serve to restore autonomy.\\nWe discuss these issues, addressing the conflict between\\nautonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence, human dig-\\nnity, the experiences of patients and the effects of\\ncoercive measures. We argue that an appeal to respect\\nautonomy and/or human dignity cannot be a sufficient\\nreason to reject coercive measures. All together, these\\nethical aspects can be used both to support and to reject\\na non-seclusion approach.\\nThe total lack of controlled trials about the beneficial\\neffects of coercive measures in different populations\\nhowever, argues against the use of coercive measures.\\nEthical concerns about methods in psychiatry have\\nbeen\\ndiscussed\\nfor\\nat\\nleast\\nthree\\ncenturies.1\\nMethods used for controlling behaviour, such as\\nseclusion and restraint, have been particularly\\nquestioned.2 3 A consensus, concerning an optimal\\ntheoretical framework for ethical decision-making,\\nhas not yet been reached.4 Until the 1960s mental\\nhealth legislation reflected a paternalistic approach\\ntowards involuntary psychiatric treatment, includ-\\ning seclusion, and this was considered to be\\nacceptable in the case of patients who were\\nincompetent to decide.5 In the last 40 years we\\nhave witnessed a development towards more\\npatient autonomy in healthcare.6 This has resulted\\nin renewed discussions about the use of seclusion\\nand\\nrestraint\\nin\\npsychiatry.7\\nNew\\nlegislation,\\nrecommendations and professional guidelines to\\ncontrol the use of coercive measures in psychiatry\\nhave since then emerged.8 In recent literature many\\ninstitutions, associations and hospitals have come\\nup with programmes to reduce seclusion and\\nrestraint.5 9–13 The reasons named to substantiate\\nthe need for reduction of seclusion and restraint\\nare: respect for autonomy, human dignity and the\\nnet negative consequences in the sense of trau-\\nmatic and harmful experiences during seclusion\\nand restraint. At the same time coercion remained\\njustified in certain circumstances in which patients\\nare a danger to others or to themselves.9 14–17 Some\\ngo further and committed themselves to eliminat-\\ning the use of seclusion and restraint comple-\\ntely.12 18 The contribution this paper wants to\\nmake is to discuss whether we can justify not using\\ncoercive measures at all, especially seclusion.\\nBACKGROUND\\nDefinition and prevalence\\nThere are a number of definitions for seclusion in\\nthe international literature. Lendemeijer has for-\\nmulated the following definition after reviewing\\nthe literature on seclusion in psychiatry: ‘‘Locking\\na patient alone in a room for protection of the\\npatient and his environment and in order to\\ncontrol problem behaviour and to enable nursing\\nand treatment’’.7 Patients can voluntarily choose to\\nbe secluded, however this paper will address\\ninvoluntarily use of seclusion. The definition above\\nimplies that seclusion itself is not a form of\\ntreatment but an intervention to make treatment\\npossible. Some people even see the use of seclusion\\nand restraint as treatment failure.11 12 Some articles\\ndo, however, describe therapeutic effects of seclu-\\nsion; patients become calm and gain access to\\nrepressed\\nmemories\\nduring\\nseclusion\\ndue\\nto\\ndecreased stimulation from sensory overload. Also\\nit has been described that seclusion provides\\neffective means for preventing injury and reducing\\nagitation.19 20 The question remains whether effects\\nshould be attributed to the seclusion room itself, to\\nthe placement of a patient in a seclusion room, or\\nto all activities around the secluded patient.\\nSeclusion is still commonly used in psychiatry,\\nhowever the frequency of use is unclear. There is\\ngreat variation in the type and frequency of using\\ncoercive measures between countries. Published\\nresearch studies mostly report data from one\\nhospital, which may not be representative of\\npractice in the country of origin.21 Furthermore,\\nstudies\\npublished\\nuse\\ndifferent\\ndefinitions\\nof\\nseclusion, study different populations and use\\ndifferent\\nendpoints\\nto\\nexpress\\nthe\\nfrequency,\\nwhich makes comparison difficult. Percentages of\\npatients who are involved with seclusion during an\\nadmission vary from 1.9–66%, and the average\\nduration also varies greatly between countries and\\nhospitals and study populations.7 20\\nPatient-related and non-patient-related influences\\nThe associations between seclusion and patient-\\nrelated\\nfactors\\nof\\nage,\\ngender,\\ndiagnosis\\nand\\nethnicity are also unclear; seclusion seems to be\\nassociated with younger patients and a diagnosis of\\nschizophrenia, manic-states or personality disor-\\nders.5 7 8 12 19 22–24\\nCharacteristics of the staff, such as their educa-\\ntional level, clinical experience and gender also\\nseem to be factors associated with seclusion.7 9 20 In\\naddition hospital characteristics seem to play a\\nrole, for example, architectural aspects and the\\npatient-to-staff ratio.

Any given situation of\\ndeciding on seclusion will be based on the history of the\\nsubjective self of the decision-maker.26 This means that the\\nmoral conscience of the caregiver, the culture of the institution\\nin which he works, the legislation, former decisions and the\\nideas of colleagues, relatives and superiors play a key role in the\\ndecision to seclude or not. In order to reduce the use of seclusion\\nand restraint a change of culture is the key.11\\nWe can conclude that the decision to use seclusion not only\\ndepends on the behaviour of the patient but also on many\\ncomplex factors associated with the caregiver and the institu-\\ntion. This causes discussion about the use of seclusion as such.\\nTherefore it is time to discuss the question whether a complete\\nnon-seclusion approach can be justified.\\nETHICAL ISSUES\\nAt first glance respect for autonomy and the violation of human\\ndignity would seem to support a non-seclusion approach.\\nLikewise, the effects of seclusion—protection from harm and\\ncreating a therapeutic climate—would seem to support the use\\nof seclusion.\\nAutonomy\\nAs mentioned already, the development towards more patient\\nautonomy in healthcare is a trend of the last 40 years. A\\npresumption in favour of individual self-determination has\\ndeveloped, and critique on a paternalistic approach to the\\nhealthcare relationship.27 The consequences of this for psychia-\\ntry are expressed by P Soloff: ‘‘As attitudes toward ‘madness’\\nbecome more enlightened, social pressure toward greater free-\\ndom and less restrictive care push the psychiatrist to the limits\\nof safety in managing the truly disturbed patient’’.28\\nThere have been three kinds of attacks against a central role\\nfor autonomy in medical ethics.\\nFirstly, autonomy is just one of the prima facie principles to\\ntake account of; there is no reason why autonomy should have\\npriority over all other moral considerations as, for instance,\\nbeneficence. Beauchamp & Childress,29 in their influential book\\nabout biomedical ethics, firmly deny that respect for autonomy\\noverrides all other moral considerations. They construct a\\nconception of autonomy that is not excessively individualistic\\n(ie, not neglecting the social nature of individuals and the\\nimpact of individual choices and actions on others), and not\\nunduly legalistic (ie, not highlighting legal rights and down-\\nplaying social practices).29\\nSecondly, the concept of autonomy itself is broader; the ideal\\nof\\nautonomy\\nin\\nterms\\nof\\ncomplete\\nself-sufficiency\\nand\\nindependency, free from controlling factors does not exist. It\\nhas been argued that autonomy cannot be seen in isolation from\\nother persons and relationships. Instead, it has been stressed\\nthat autonomy as a moral capacity can only be developed in\\nrelation to others; in other words, autonomy is relational\\nautonomy.30\\nThirdly, there are moral values which are more fundamental\\nthan autonomy. Campbell,27 following Pellegrino, argues that\\ndependency is a moral principle, and that it is more funda-\\nmental than autonomy. He argues that a very independent\\nindividual could be lacking in autonomy, in the sense that he\\ncannot consistently exercise any degree of self-direction and\\ncannot\\nfunction\\nas\\na\\nmember\\nof\\nsociety.\\nConversely\\na\\ndependent individual (eg, a partner in a marriage) can still\\nexercise autonomy. Campbell claims that dependency and\\nautonomy are not polar opposites.27\\nThe consequence of these attacks is that we cannot dismiss\\nseclusion by invoking autonomy only, without paying attention\\nto other moral principles and without paying attention to the\\nrelational context of autonomy.\\nVerkerk agrees with this concept of autonomy and depen-\\ndency in which the relational context plays an important role\\nand pleas for the possibility of ‘‘compassionate interference’’ in\\nhealthcare. ‘‘Interventions in care can be shown to be in the\\ninterest of patients, that is they can be seen as interventions for\\nattaining autonomy instead of threatening autonomy’’.30 So it\\ncan be argued that to avoid self-destructive behaviour some-\\ntimes coercive measures can be necessary to foster or to regain\\nautonomy. When we see seclusion as an intervention for\\nattaining autonomy instead of threatening autonomy we have\\nlost one reason for eliminating seclusion completely. Obviously,\\nthis does not mean that seclusion does not raise many issues\\nrelated to autonomy.\\nIt seems the natural thing to consider paternalism here as\\nwell. Paternalism has been described as a conflict between\\nbeneficence and autonomy.29 However, since we will show that\\nthere are no scientific grounds for the beneficial effect of\\nseclusion or restraint for the psychiatric patient, there can not\\nbe a conflict between violating autonomy and beneficence. Even\\nif we would assume (in the absence of supporting data), that\\nseclusion itself is beneficent using it would amount to a form of\\nweak paternalism because a person’s competency will be\\ncompromised in some way by its psychiatric disorder.\\nHuman dignity\\nViolation of human dignity is often used as an argument against\\nseclusion.18 31 32 With regard to the application of biology and\\nmedicine the dignity and identity of all human beings must be\\nprotected and respect for their integrity, without discrimina-\\ntion, and other rights and fundamental freedoms must be\\nguaranteed.33\\nHuman dignity is often used as a central concept in our\\ncontemporary moral vocabulary, but both the content of the\\nnotion and its basis as a moral category are often left\\nunspecified; there is not enough clarity about the meaning of\\nhuman dignity.34 There are at least two conceptions of dignity:\\n(1) ‘‘inherent dignity’’ of every human person as a universal and\\ninalienable moral quality which can not be earned and can not\\nbe taken away; and (2) ‘‘individualistic dignity’’ that is tied to\\npersonal goals and social circumstances, which can be either\\nenhanced or diminished depending upon a variety of circum-\\nstances. Dignity, in this sense, can be affected by events outside\\nthe control of the persons involved, a debilitating disease, for\\nexample, might rob one of one’s dignity.35\\nIn the context of seclusion a violation of inherent dignity will\\nmostly be the case. Although this characteristic of humans\\ncannot be taken away from the patient, we can act in a way\\nthat is not in accordance with it and as such violate it. In case of\\n‘‘individualistic dignity’’, however, things are less clear.\\nNordenfelt describes ‘‘the dignity of identity’’ as ‘‘the dignity\\nthat we attach to ourselves as integrated and autonomous\\npersons, persons with a history and persons with a future with\\nall out relationships to other human beings’’.36 This dignity is\\nstrongly associated with self-respect and feelings of worth.\\nResearch ethics\\n70\\nJ Med Ethics 2009;35:69–73. doi:10.1136/jme.2007.022780\\ngroup.bmj.com\\n on September 18, 2016 - Published by \\nhttp://jme.bmj.com/\\nDownloaded from \\n'),\n",

Intrusion in\\nthe private sphere is a violation of a person’s integrity but it also\\nentails a change in the person’s identity and thereby his dignity.\\nIn this sense it can be argued that seclusion does intrude in\\nthe private sphere of the patient and entails a change in the\\npatient’s identity and thereby violates the patient dignity. In\\nthis way it can be argued that we ought not to use seclusion.\\nOn the other hand a study about patients’ perceptions of the\\nconcept\\nof\\ndignity\\nin\\na\\npsychiatric\\nsetting\\nshowed\\nthat\\n‘‘encountering competent and committed staff’’, ‘‘being con-\\nfirmed’’, ‘‘being looked upon as like anyone else’’, ‘‘being helped to\\nreduce the shame’’ and ‘‘being understood’’ are conditions\\nassociated with respect for dignity.37 It is unclear if seclusion\\nviolates human dignity in this sense, when it is done by\\ncompetent staff, with confirmation and understanding of the\\npatient and in a way that reduces the shame. It seems that respect\\nfor human dignity in this view says nothing about whether we\\nshould use seclusion or not but about the way we use it.\\nFurthermore, it can be argued that patients have already been\\nrobbed of their dignity by their disease and the situation that\\nleads to seclusion. Both Pullman and Nordenfelt argue that a\\ndisabling disease can rob one of one’s dignity. Seclusion might\\nbe necessary to reach a breakthrough in the situation and to\\nregain one’s dignity by regaining self-respect. When we argue in\\nthis way, it follows that seclusion remains a problem in one\\nunderstanding of dignity, but does not necessarily block the use\\nof seclusion in another. That view leads to the conclusion that\\nseclusion must be done with respect for human dignity in a way\\nthat is least violating.\\nExperiences of patients\\nAnother important issue in the moral debate on seclusion are\\nthe experiences of patients; do they feel non-autonomous and\\nviolated in their dignity? Literature predominantly reports\\nnegative seclusion room experiences, but positive experiences\\nhave also been reported, especially a considerable time after\\nseclusion.38 Important factors mentioned by patients are the\\nlack of adequate information and education about seclusion.39\\nPatients report most negative experiences when they do not\\nunderstand the reason for seclusion and when they do not have\\nthe possibilities to discuss it with others.38 Treatment must be\\nindividualised treatment which means that it must be discussed\\nwith the patient, it must be reviewed and revised regularly, and it\\nmust be provided by adequately qualified staff.40\\nPatients do see beneficial effects of seclusion to themselves. In\\none study both nursing staff and patients generally believed\\nseclusion to be beneficial to the patient some of the time.\\nHowever, significant differences were found between nurses’\\nand patients’ perceptions of the extent of benefit, with only 4%\\nof patients and 60% of nurses believing the procedure to be\\noften beneficial to the secluded patient.41\\nThese studies seem to say something about the way we use\\nseclusion and about the reasons and frequency of seclusion, not\\nabout whether we should use it or not (as has been argued for\\nthe violation of dignity). In Meehan’s study only 22% of the\\npatients and 2% of the staff were in favour of eliminating\\nseclusion completely.41\\nEffects of seclusion; promoting wellbeing\\nThe definition of seclusion (locking a patient alone in a room for\\nprotection of the patient and his environment, in order to\\ncontrol problem behaviour, and to enable nursing and treat-\\nment) implies that it is used with good intentions, namely to\\nprotect the patient and his environment and to create a\\ntherapeutic situation. This is a view of seclusion based on\\ndoing good and avoiding (further) harm. Indications for\\nseclusion (and restraint) are: (1) to prevent imminent harm to\\nthe patient or other persons; (2) to prevent serious disruption of\\nthe treatment programme or significant damage to the physical\\nenvironment (to the patient or to the group); (3) to assist in\\ntreatment as part of ongoing behaviour therapy; and (4) to\\ndecrease the stimulation a patient receives.42 Whether seclusion\\nhelps to reach these goals is completely unclear as there is no\\nevidence for its effects. The conclusion of a review by the\\nCochrane library in the year 2000 is that there are no controlled\\nstudies that evaluate the value of seclusion or restraint in those\\npatients with serious mental illness.43 Since then, as far we\\nknow, no controlled trials have been published. In the absence\\nof controlled trials, the observations by clinicians remain and\\nthey sometimes report positive effects, as mentioned before.41\\nThese observations may be correct in the reported cases but the\\nquestion remains whether they would be the same in other\\ncases, whether these effects can be attributed to seclusion itself\\nand whether seclusion is the appropriate measure. There is no\\nevidence that seclusion is better than alternatives, such as forced\\ndrug treatment in preventing harm and disruption, in assisting\\nin treatment and decreasing overstimulation.\\nFurthermore negative effects have been published. Fisher\\nconcludes in his review that the use of seclusion and restraint\\ncan have substantial deleterious physical and psychological\\neffects on both patient and staff.19 The Citizens Commission on\\nHuman Rights published Deadly restraints, psychiatry’s ‘‘ther-\\napeutic’’ assault, a report that summarised reports of deaths,\\npatient abuse and neglect as a result of seclusion and restraint.44\\nThese reports, however, do not describe controlled trials about\\nthe negative effects.\\nIn the absence of any controlled trials in patients with serious\\nmental illness, no recommendation can be made about the\\neffectiveness, benefit or harmfulness of seclusion or restraint.\\nThis lack of evidence and reports of serious adverse effects do\\nnot mean that seclusion cannot be practical and safe. But when\\nwe want to practice evidenced based medicine it is arguable that\\nthe use of seclusion should only be continued in the context of\\nrandomised trials.43 The design of such a study will not be\\nwithout problems, but we submit that a study using a cluster\\nrandomised design would be feasible and ethically defensible.\\nThe lack of evidence of positive effects of seclusion supports a\\nnon-seclusion\\napproach.\\nIt\\nshould\\nstimulate\\nus\\nto\\nfind\\nalternative methods of dealing with extreme circumstances of\\naggressive behaviour in which the safety of the patient or others\\nis threatened.\\nDISCUSSION\\nAt first we assumed that respect for autonomy and the violation\\nof human dignity would support a complete non-seclusion\\napproach. On basis of the explanation just given we can contest\\nthis assumption. Both autonomy and dignity can be used to\\nsupport seclusion and to reject a non-seclusion approach. In a\\ncertain way coercion voids an act of autonomy, on the other\\nhand it can be argued that seclusion in healthcare is sometimes\\nnecessary for attaining autonomy, instead of always threaten-\\ning autonomy.29 30 To a certain extent the same goes for\\n(individualistic) dignity. The ambiguity in these ethical con-\\ncepts makes clear that an appeal to respect for autonomy and/or\\nhuman dignity can not be a sufficient reason to reject seclusion.\\nResearch ethics\\nJ Med Ethics 2009;35:69–73. doi:10.1136/jme.2007.022780\\n71\\ngroup.bmj.com\\n on September 18, 2016 - Published by \\nhttp://jme.bmj.com/\\nDownloaded from \\n'),\n",

One study\\nreports a 52% reduction of seclusion, this unfortunately was\\naccompanied by a significant increase of assault on patients.10\\nAnother study, which used data of nine hospitals, reports a total\\nelimination of seclusion and restraint in five of the nine\\nhospitals, without an increase of patient assault.12 Most\\nreduction programmes, however, do not reach a 100% reduc-\\ntion. It seems that there remain circumstances of extreme\\nproblem behaviour with danger to the patient or others, which\\nneed to be controlled by coercive measures such as seclusion,\\nrestraint or forced medication. There is no data to guide clinical\\ndecisions as to which combination of seclusion, restraint and/or\\nforced medication would be better in specific patient popula-\\ntions.20 It can be argued, however, that forced drug treatment\\nmight even be more harmful than seclusion. Part of this\\nargument is that the medication is given as an intramuscular\\ninjection and thus violates the borders of the human body. Also\\nmost medication causes a lowering of consciousness which can\\nbe seen as violating autonomy. And when the patient is\\nadmitted for the first time and has no known diagnosis, the\\nobservation of a secluded patient can give the psychiatrist more\\n(diagnostic) information than observing a tranquilised patient.\\nOn the other hand one could argue that there is a more direct\\nrelation between some states of illness and giving specific\\nmedication, for example, in cases of psychosis and anti\\npsychotic drugs. Obviously, this would not be the case when\\ntranquillisers are used as these drugs can be seen as a form of\\nchemical restraint.\\nAn obvious hiatus in the total discussion about coercive\\nmeasures is the lack of clear definitions and data of its use, and\\nthe total lack of trials in which different measures are compared\\nand effects are investigated.\\nThe council of Europe, contrary to the earlier recommenda-\\ntions, states that the use of mechanical restraint is not\\nprohibited: ‘‘isolation and mechanical or other means of\\nrestraint for prolonged periods should be resorted to only in\\nexceptional cases where there is no other means of remedying\\nthe situation’’. Furthermore, patients have the right to receive\\ntreatment in the least restrictive environment and using the\\nleast restrictive means appropriate to the patient’s health and\\nthe need to protect the safety of others.40 There is, however, a\\nlack\\nof\\nconsensus\\nregarding\\nwhich\\nmethod\\nis\\nthe\\nleast\\nrestrictive.20 This absence of data should guide future efficacy\\nand effectiveness studies.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn contrast to many reports, we have argued that reasons such\\nas respect for autonomy and the violation of human dignity are\\nnot sufficient reasons to eliminate seclusion. Altogether, at least\\nin some interpretations, these norms can be used both to\\nsupport and to reject a non-seclusion approach.\\nReduction programmes do not reach a 100% reduction of\\ncoercive measures in psychiatry; there remain circumstances\\nwherein coercive measures seems to be the only option to\\ncontrol problem behaviour.\\nThe total lack of controlled trials about the effects of\\nseclusion in different populations, however, argues against the\\nuse of seclusion even in these extreme circumstances in which\\nthe safety of the patient or others is threatened. It is very hard\\nto argue that seclusion is the appropriate measure to control\\nthese circumstances when there are no data to support this. The\\nuse of seclusion should therefore only be continued in the\\ncontext of randomised trials, in which the effects of seclusion in\\nextreme circumstance most be explored and in which this must\\nbe\\ncompared\\nwith\\nother\\nmeasures\\nsuch\\nas\\nforced\\ndrug\\ntreatment. Designing a controlled trial in which individuals\\nare randomised to intervention may be difficult, but a cluster\\nrandomised trial must be possible. We have argued that we can\\nneither rule out nor accept coercive measures relying on\\nautonomy or dignitarian grounds alone. We do need to know\\nwhether coercive measures are beneficent to complete the\\nargument, and therefore research is necessary. For as long there\\nis no evidence for positive effects of seclusion the precaution\\nprinciple of ‘‘primum non nocere’’ should guide our actions.\\nCompeting interests: None.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.\\nBloch S, Pargiter R.

       "## 1. Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "This paper aims to delve into the complex and controversial issue of coercive measures in psychiatry, specifically seclusion. The authors acknowledge the ethical, legal, and clinical complexities surrounding this practice, particularly when considering the temporary nature of mental incapacity and the potential for coercive measures to restore autonomy. The paper examines the tension between autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence, human dignity, patient experiences, and the effects of coercive measures. Ultimately, the authors argue that while respect for autonomy and human dignity are crucial considerations, they are not sufficient reasons to completely reject coercive measures. \n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Background\n",
       "\n",
       "The paper establishes a clear definition of seclusion as the practice of isolating a patient in a room for safety and control of behavior. The prevalence of seclusion remains unclear, with significant variations across countries and institutions, making comparisons difficult.  The decision to seclude a patient is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including patient behavior, caregiver characteristics, and institutional culture. This complexity highlights the need for a nuanced discussion about the justification of a complete non-seclusion approach. \n",
       "\n",
       "## 3. Ethical Issues\n",
       "\n",
       "The authors meticulously analyze the ethical implications of seclusion, focusing on autonomy and human dignity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Autonomy**: The authors argue that while the trend towards patient autonomy in healthcare is commendable, autonomy is not an absolute moral principle and cannot override all other considerations.  Autonomy is relational and can be developed through interactions with others. Furthermore, dependency is a fundamental moral principle that can coexist with autonomy. Coercive measures, like seclusion, may be necessary to foster or regain autonomy in cases of self-destructive behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Human Dignity**: The authors explore two conceptions of human dignity: inherent and individualistic. While seclusion violates inherent dignity, the violation of individualistic dignity is more nuanced. Seclusion can intrude on a patient's private sphere and affect their identity, potentially violating their dignity. However, respect for human dignity might focus on how seclusion is used rather than whether it should be used at all.  The authors posit that patients may have already experienced a loss of dignity due to their illness and that seclusion could be necessary to regain self-respect and dignity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Experiences of Patients**: Patients report both negative and positive experiences with seclusion. Negative experiences are often linked to a lack of information and education about the procedure. However, patients may also recognize the potential benefits of seclusion, particularly in calming and providing a respite from overwhelming stimulation.  This suggests that the way seclusion is used, including communication and education, significantly influences patient experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Effects of Seclusion; Promoting Wellbeing**: The authors highlight the lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of seclusion, despite its intended purpose of protecting patients and creating a therapeutic environment. While some clinicians report positive effects, the absence of controlled trials leaves the efficacy of seclusion in question.  The authors also cite evidence of negative effects of seclusion, including physical and psychological harm. This lack of evidence for positive effects and the presence of documented negative effects strongly advocates for a non-seclusion approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 4. Discussion\n",
       "\n",
       "The authors emphasize the ambiguity of ethical concepts like autonomy and human dignity, acknowledging that these concepts can be used to both support and reject a non-seclusion approach. While reduction programs are encouraged, the authors highlight that these programs do not eliminate coercive measures entirely. The lack of clear definitions, data, and controlled trials comparing different coercive measures further complicates the issue.  The authors raise the possibility that forced drug treatment, often seen as an alternative to seclusion, might be even more harmful due to its invasiveness and potential for violating autonomy. \n",
       "\n",
       "## 5. Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The authors conclude that autonomy and human dignity are not sufficient reasons to eliminate seclusion entirely.  The lack of controlled trials on the effects of seclusion strongly argues against its use, even in extreme circumstances. The authors advocate for the use of seclusion only within the context of randomized trials to determine its effectiveness and compare it to other measures. In the absence of evidence for positive effects, the precautionary principle of \"primum non nocere\" (first, do no harm) should guide our actions.\n"
